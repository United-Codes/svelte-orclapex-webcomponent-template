## FAQ

- Q: **Why WebComponents?** 
  - A: WebComponents are a standard and can be used in any framework or library. They are exposed via own HTML tags which makes them easy to use in Oracle APEX plug-ins. Their style and logic is encapsulated and can be reused by just adding the tag to the page.
- Q: **Why Svelte?**
  - A: Svelte has a nice and easy to use syntax, an existing ecosystem and compiles to small and fast vanilla JS.
- Q: **How is this tailored for Oracle APEX?**
  - A: The template loads all the APEX sources so you can use Font APEX, APEX CSS classes and the APEX JS API while locally developing your WebComponent.
- Q: **Why a local development server?**
  - A: Speed. Put your editor and a browser side by side and see changes instantly. No need to upload files to APEX to see changes.
